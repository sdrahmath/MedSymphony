Condition: ADHD

I've been struggling with focus and attention for as long as I can remember. It's not just the occasional daydreaming; it's a constant battle to stay on track, whether at work, school, or in daily tasks. I find myself easily distracted, and it's affecting my performance and relationships. Simple tasks become overwhelming, and I often feel like my mind is racing with thoughts that I can't control. It's frustrating, and I'm starting to realize that this isn't just a phase.

Condition: High Blood Pressure

I have experienced a bit of dizziness, especially in the first few days after taking HypoPress. It's not persistent, but it does happen occasionally. I mentioned this to my doctor during a follow-up, and they suggested monitoring it. Besides that, I haven't noticed any major side effects. In terms of lifestyle changes, I've also been more conscious of my diet, reducing sodium intake and incorporating more fruits and vegetables. The combination of medication and lifestyle adjustments seems to be working well for me.

I'm also making an effort to adopt a more balanced diet, keeping an eye on my carbohydrate intake. So far, it seems like the medication, coupled with dietary adjustments, is having a positive impact on my blood sugar stability.

The combination of the medication and dietary changes appears to be making a difference in how I feel
